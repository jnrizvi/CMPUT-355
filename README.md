## Using the programs
1. Change directory into the assignment4/ folder.
2. Make sure you have all required python libraries installed.
3. The game is available in two versions; simple_minesweeper.py plays in the terminal and lacks some complexity. gui_minesweeper.py is **recommended** and opens up GUI window using TKinter. Run either program by entering python3 simple_minesweeper.py or python3 gui_minesweeper.py.
